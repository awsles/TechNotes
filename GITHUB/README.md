## Resources
In addition to tech notes, below are some additional AWS-related resources:

* [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
-- A cheatsheet for github markdown.

* [Another Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
-- This one is a bit more pleasing on the eye.

* [Github-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github)
-- GitHub combines a syntax for formatting text called GitHub Flavored Markdown with a few unique writing features.

* [Github Emojis](https://emojipedia.org/github/)
-- GitHub uses shortcodes for emoji insertion which replace the code with the native emoji character.
The syntax is :*emojiname*: For example, the text `:Octocat:` generates this: :octocat:.
The current list of github emojis can be returned via [REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/emojis/).
An almost-complete list may be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908).
