# AWS 
An area for tech notes relating to Amazon Web Services.

**Comments and contributions are welcomed!**

## Tech Notes
Current tech notes include:

* [Enumerating AWS Resources](https://github.com/lesterw1/TechNotes/blob/master/AWS/Enumerating%20AWS%20Resources.md)
-- The challenges of enumerating all resources in an AWS account, and across multiple AWS accounts.


## Articles
In addition to tech notes, here are some articles:

* [Azure or AWS... Which is more secure?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/azure-aws-which-more-secure-lester-waters)
In this article, I take a look at the security-related features of Azure and AWS and do a cursory comparison.
Both platforms have evolved quite a bit since I published that article in February 2019. A full update will be forthcoming.
