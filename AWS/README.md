## Tech Notes
Current tech notes include:

## Articles
In addition to tech notes, here are some articles:

* [Azure or AWS... Which is more secure?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/azure-aws-which-more-secure-lester-waters)
In this article, I take a look at the security-related features of Azure and AWS and do a cursory comparison.
Both platforms have evolved quite a bit since I published that article in February 2019. A full update will be forthcoming.

## Additional Resources
In addition to tech notes, below are some additional AWS-related resources:

* [AWS Services & Actions](https://github.com/lesterw1/AwsServices)
-- Provides a list of all known AWS actions (used in policy documents) and services.
Source code for generating the list is included.
